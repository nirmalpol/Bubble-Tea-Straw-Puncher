# Bubble Tea Straw Puncher

  This design was inspired by the frustration that many bubble tea lovers face on a regular basis. Pushing the straw into the cup SUCCESSFULLY and WITHOUT spilling some of the drink. Hence, during the UltraHacks Hackathon, my team consisted of Edward Luo, Johnny Ye, and Rui Gao. Our group ended up focusing on developing, constructing, and coding the design using a microservo motor (SG90), a stepper motor with its driver, a microswitch, and a 9V battery.
